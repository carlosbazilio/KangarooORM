# Kangaroo ORM

Kangaroo is a Kotlin-Postgres ORM built for those who search for a reliable and easy way to implement 
data storage with Kotlin and Postgres in your applications.

Kotlin is a fabulous language, and a lot of applications must implement data storage, but the database is not the
main topic of these applications. So the programmer now can implement this database with a lot of simplicity. 
Kangaroo is reliable, so once your model's well done, you do not have to worry about the database, and can focus in
the other topics of your applications. But the most important, Kangaroo brings together the better in both object oriented programming
 world and database world: Kotlin and PostgresSQL.
